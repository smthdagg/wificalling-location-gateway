## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- One integrated, project-named package containing Wi-Fi Calling Gateway 1.7,
  the Rust WLOC service and control client, and unified LuCI/rpcd management.
- AX6S AArch64/cortex-a53 IPK plus x86-64 IPK for OpenWrt/iStoreOS 24.x and
  native APK v3 for OpenWrt 25.x.
- Automatic node-following and manual location modes, CA/profile lifecycle,
  bounded TLS-over-HTTP/2 handling, exit/Geo resolution, and status logging.
- Reproducible pinned builds, SHA-256 release manifests, dependency/license
  auditing, secret scanning, coverage gates, and three-platform Docker smoke
  verification.

### Fixed

- Automatic-to-manual WLOC mode switching now uses the live control socket and
  returns a controlled error without losing the saved configuration.
- Reinstall and upgrade preserve both `/etc/config/wificalling-gateway` and
  `/etc/config/wloc-service`; users no longer need to remove either component.

### Safety

- WLOC interception remains isolated from UDP 500/4500 and the Gateway table.
- Invalid Geo/protocol/TLS state never produces a default fake coordinate.
